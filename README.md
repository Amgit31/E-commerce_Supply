# E-commerce_Supply_Chian_Analysis

This project aims to perform comprehensive supply chain analysis for a company using Python. As a data analyst, I've developed a set of tools and scripts to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize supply chain data, providing valuable insights into the company's logistics and procurement processes. To analyze a company's supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain like data sourcing,manufacturing,transportation,sales and customer demographic. #Key Features: Data Collection: Utilize Python to collect data from various sources, including APIs, databases, and external datasets, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Data Cleaning: Employ data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the integrity of the dataset. Analysis and Modeling: Leverage statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns, trends, and potential areas for optimization within the supply chain. Visualization: Create interactive visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate key findings and trends effectively. #Technologies Used Python: Pandas, NumPy Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn,plotly Data Collection: Requests, Pandas Database Integration: SQLite, SQLAlchemy Jupyter Notebooks: Utilized for exploratory data analysis and documentation.

## Data set

[supply_chain_data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17461841/supply_chain_data.csv)

### Tools

M S Excel- Data cleaning
Jupeter notebook- For analysing the data and get insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is involved in exploring the Ecomm Data to answer key questions, such as :
1. Make a visualization on the price of a product and the revenue generated them.
2. Analyse the Sales by product type.
3. Find out the Total Revenue generated from shipping carriers.
4. Analyze the Revenue generated by each SKU.
5. Analyze the Order Quantity of each SKU.
6. Analyze Shipping Cost of each SKU.
7. Find out the Cost Distribution by Transportation Mode.
8. Analyze the Defect Rate of Product during Shipping.

### Data Analysis
 
 Data Analysis is done by connecting data from  to the "[supply_chain_data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17462275/supply_chain_data.csv)"
Jupeter Notebook, calculating the results from the data.
